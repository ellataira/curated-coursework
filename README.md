A collection of previous coursework I have completed at Northeastern University. 

## Computer Systems (CS3650) 
- C and Assembly 
- All assignments were completed on terminal using Vim. 
- From this course, I improved my skills in a Unix environment, inspected and debugged at a low level, learned about concurrency and parallelism, and generally improved my understanding of operating systems. 

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS4100) 
- Python 
- In this course, I completed a series of Pacman programming assignments from UC Berkeley that explored topics such as algorithmic search, multi-agent game play, and reinforcement learning.
